# shinydashboardPlus 2.0.0

This release is a major step for shinydashboardPlus. It is also a significant breaking
change compared to the latest CRAN version. Overall this release will simplify the transition from shinydashboard to shinydashboardPlus and bring more consistency, more interactivity between components. Below is the changelog.

## Breaking changes
- Change _maxstar_ and _grade_ in `starBlock()` to `max` and `value`.
- Remove _footerPadding_ from `boxPlus()` to align with `{bs4Dash}`
- Remove all sidebar related parameters from `boxPlus()`. This is now part of the new `boxPlusSidebar()`
- remove _dropdownIcon_ parameter from `boxPlus()`. It is now part of the `dropdownItemList()`
- Remove all label params from `boxPlus()`. This is to reduce the number of parameters of cards. Now part of `boxPlusLabel()`
- In `dropdownItemList()` _icon_ must be provided as `shiny::icon()` and not a simple string containing the icon name. This is to be consistent with {shinydashboard}
- Replace _left_text_ and _right_text_ by _left_ and _right_, respectively in `dashboardFooter()`
- Remove all sidebar related parameters of `dashboardPagePlus()`. They now belong to `dashboardSidebarPlus()` to Align with {shinydashboard}
- In `dashboardSidebarPlus()`: replace _rightSidebar_ by _controlbar_ (align with {bs4Dash}). Rename _enable_preloader_ to _preloader_ and _loading_duration_ to _duration_
- Rename `rightSidebar()` to `dashboardControlbar()` to align with {bs4Dash}
- Remove _enable_rightSidebar_ from `dashboardHeaderPlus()`. This is now part of `dashboardControlbar()` as _disable_ like in {shinydashboard}. _rightSidebarIcon_ becomes
_controlbarIcon_ that accepts `shiny::icon` instead of a simple string containing the icon name to be consistent with {shinydashboard}. _left_menu_ becomes _leftUi_ like in {bs4Dash}
- Remove `rightSiderbarMenu()`, `rightSidebarTablist()`, `rightSidebarTabItem()`, `rightSidebarPanel()` and `rightSidebarTabContent()`. They are now replaces by `dashboardControlbar()`, `controlbarMenu()` and `controlbarItem()`
- Remove `rightSidebarMenuItem()`, `menuIcon()` and `menuInfo()`
- Rename `boxPlus()` to `box()`, `dashboardPagePlus()` to `dashboardPage()` and
`dashboardHeaderPlus()` to `dashboardHeader()`
- `dropdownBlock()` _icon_ expects a `shiny::icon()` and not a simple string containing the icon name. This is to be consistent with {shinydashboard}
- In `gradientBox()` _icon_ expects a `shiny::icon()` and not a simple string containing the icon name. This is to be consistent with {shinydashboard}
- In `descriptionBlock()` _icon_ expects a `shiny::icon()` and not a simple string containing the icon name. This is to be consistent with {shinydashboard}
- Rework `navPillsItem()`: _pillName_ becomes _left_, _pillText_ becomes _right_,
_pillColor_ becomes _color_, _pillIcon_ becomes _icon_ and expects a `shiny::icon()`. Add _inputId_ so that the item behaves like an action button
- Rework `productListItem()`: _productTitle_ becomes _title_, _productPrice_ becomes _subtitle_, _priceColor_ becomes _color_

- `dropdownItemList()` becomes `boxDropdown()`. `dropdownItem()` becomes `boxDropdownItem()`
- `userPostToolItemList()` becomes `userPostTagItems()`. `userPostToolItem()` becomes `userPostTagItem()`

- Add _icon_, _gradient_ and _boxToolSize_ to `box()`
- _title_ mandatory in `userBox()`. Remove _background_. Replace _backgroundUrl_ by _backgroundImage_. Reworked _type_ parameter
- Restore `accordion()` id. We should distinguish between TRUE inputs (sliderInput) and secondary inputs (that you can use for interactivity)...
- _color_ becomes _status_ in `accordionItem()`. This is to be consistent with AdminLTE2 classes and {shinydashboard}
- In `attachmentBlock()`: _src_ becomes _image_ and _titleUrl_ becomes _href_. _image_ is mandatory

- add _width_ to `accordion()` (default to 12)
- Simplified dependencies code (No end-user impact)

## Bug fixes
- Fix #102: dashboardUser not displayed when using shinydashboard::sidebarMenuOutput. ensureActivatedTab was not
in the global scope, whereas it was needed by the output binding code 
- Fix #107: `collapsed = FALSE` not working for dashboardControlbar. 
- Fix #56: When controlbar is expanded/collapsed, a plot does not fit in body. 
- Fix #78: Menu Item with Sub Menu Item Arrow Not Rotating.
- Fix #105: box animation speed. Allow user defined options to prevail over internals.

shinydashboard sidebar. Thanks @ajfisher83 
- Fix ugly layout of the box body (wrong padding and margins) when one puts a sidebar in `box()`...
- _title_ is mandatory in `accordionItem()` (Setting title to NULL would prevent the item
to be able to collapse ...)
