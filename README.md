> extensions for shinydashboard

## Installation

```r
# for the CRAN version
install.packages("shinydashboardPlus")
# for the latest version
devtools::install_github("RinteRface/shinydashboardPlus")
```

## Motivations

shinydashboardPlus is based on the idea of [ygdashboard](https://github.com/gyang274/ygdashboard/tree/master/R), 
the latter not compatible with shinydashboard (you cannot use shinydashboard and ygdashboard at the same time). With shinydashboardPlus you can still work with the shinydashboard classic functions and enrich
your dashboard with all additional functions of shinydashboardPlus!

## Demo

See a demonstration [here](https://dgranjon.shinyapps.io/shinydashboardPlusDemo)
or run:
```r
library(shinydashboardPlus)
shinydashboardPlusGallery()
```

Below an example of application in medicine:
